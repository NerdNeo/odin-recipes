    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    

    <p>
        Greetings! This page is my interpreation of the first real project in 
        The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum.
        <br/><br/>

        This project is to create a simple recipe book with HTML. 
        The only specifications are that it is to "consist of a main index page 
        which will have links to a few recipes."
        <br/><br/>
        
        This page itself looks pretty crappy because it's made with only HTML, however, 
        the module right after this project taught the basics of CSS in a really awesome way,
        one of the projects in that module was to apply some CSS to the previous project,
        and I thought it would be cool to link to that version <strong><a href="../odin-recipes/with_css/index.html">HERE</a></strong>, 
        I feel like it shows just how different a page can look with some very basic CSS skills. With that said, if 
        you're looking at this on mobile it will all look bad because no responsive 
        design has been built into this webpage. I digress...
        
        <br/><br/>

        Without further ado, here are some links to some recipes of relatively unknown quality:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="../odin-recipes/recipes/lasagna.html">Lasagna</a>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="../odin-recipes/recipes/hotChocolate.html">Hot Chocolate</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../odin-recipes/recipes/monkeyBread.html">Herb & Garlic Monkey Bread</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
