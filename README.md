TOP Project 1 (Recipes)

Oh hi,

So after completing this original project, The Odin Project went on to cover some CSS basics and as a practice assignment they had me style this HTML recipe book with CSS, so I thought it might be cool to upload that to show what a little CSS can do. Anyway, today I have made some changes to the original page which I will list out bellow:

- Linked to styled version of recipe book from home page.
- Edited text on home page to link to styled page.
- Slightly adjusted the positioning of some elements.
- Added 'Home' link at bellow the h1 on each recipe page.

That is about it for now! Though, I doubt that I'll edit this site any further.

Cheers,

Neo.

    Hello READers of this README!

    This project is the first real project in The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum.

    This project is to create a simple recipe book with HTML. The only specifications are that it is to "consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes."

    For now it will look pretty horrible as it is just being built with basic HTML skills, however, the project sets the expectation that this basic design will be built out a bit more when the curriculum moves on to CSS.

    Code well,

    Neo.
