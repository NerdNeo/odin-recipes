    Hello READers of this README!

    This project is the first real project in The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum.

    This project is to create a simple recipe book with HTML. The only specifications are that it is to "consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes."

    For now it will look pretty horrible as it is just being built with basic HTML skills, however, the project sets the expectation that this basic design will be built out a bit more when the curriculum moves on to CSS.

    Code well,

    Neo.
