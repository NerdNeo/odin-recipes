    <img src="../img/monkeyBread.png" width="500">

    <p>
        For this recipe, I went with something that I'd like to actually make soon.
        <br/><br/>

        Here we have a recipe for monkey bread from my main man Babish. This man has helped me immensely in my 
        culinary endevours, and to pay him back I am ripping off his monkey bread recipe for my shitty website XD... 
        I'd like to think Babish would understand it's for educational purposes.
        <br/><br/>

        Anyway.. his video and recipe made a few variations of monkey bread, you should definitely 
        <a href="https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/monkey-bread">check that out</a> if you're interested, however, 
        I am just going with the herb & garlic variation.

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine the flour, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Evenly combine the dry ingredients using a whisk or fork. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the milk, water, and salt to the bowl. With the mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, 
            combine the dough on medium-low speed until almost homogeneous. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Begin adding the butter, one cube at a time, and waiting until each cube is incorporated 
            before adding another one until all of the butter has been added. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough is smooth, elastic, 
            and clears the sides of the bowl, about 4-5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the dough proof until about doubled in size, about 1-2 hours depending on the warmth of the room. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, grease 1 large tube or bundt pan or loaf pan or muffin tin generously with non-stick spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a lightly oiled work surface. 
            Divide and shape the dough into even golf-ball-sized portions. 
            If using a muffin tin, make portions half the size. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll the dough balls in a mixture of the melted butter, fresh herbs (of your choice), 
            salt, and pepper. Place them into the prepared baking pan(s).
        </li>
        <li>
            Loosely cover the pan(s), and allow the dough to proof for another 45 minutes - 1 hour, until puffed. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 °F. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once risen, remove the plastic wrap from the pan(s). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, turning halfway through, 
            until the dough is cooked through (200-205 °F) and golden brown on top. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes, then flip it onto a serving platter of your choice. 
            Brush the dough with any remaining herb butter. Serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
