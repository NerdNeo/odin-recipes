    <p>
        The inspiration for this here recipe came from a well timed Google alert that popped up
        as I was about to start making this page.
        <br/><br/>

        With that being said, I actually really love John Kanell of Preppy Kitchen, whose recipe I stole here,
        so I'm sure that this hot chocolate will actually be bomb.
        Please <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/hot-chocolate/#recipe">click here</a> if you would like to visit
        Preppy Kitchen's far more attractive website to read this recipe.
