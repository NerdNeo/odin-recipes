            Greetings! This page is my interpreation of the first real project in The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum.
            <br/><br/>
    
            This is actually a second iterration of this project, as the original project was just to create a simple recipe book with HTML. 
            The only specifications are that it is to "consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes."
            <br/><br/>
            
            After completing that initial project, I went on to learn some CSS, and was given the task
            to pimp this recipe book out a bit... so that is what I have done.
            <br/><br/>
    
            Without further ado, here are some links to some recipes of relatively unknown quality:
