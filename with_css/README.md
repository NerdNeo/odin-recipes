TOP Project 1 (Recipes)

Mon Dec 27, 2021. 1251hrs PST

    This is a copy of the original repo I used for the first HTML project.

    This is a more casual assignment to just give that basic recipes website some style with the basic CSS skills I've learned so far in TOP; I'm not putting it up on github, and don't intend to spend a whole lot of time on it.

    Cheers,

    Neo.

    Hello READers of this README!

    This project is the first real project in The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum.

    This project is to create a simple recipe book with HTML. The only specifications are that it is to "consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes."

    For now it will look pretty horrible as it is just being built with basic HTML skills, however, the project sets the expectation that this basic design will be built out a bit more when the curriculum moves on to CSS.

    Code well,

    Neo.
